# Recommendation System using Collaborated-Filtering
This is a complexity study of the algorithm of collaborated-filtering for recommendation system. Movie dataset of MovieLens was used in this study obtained from <http://grouplens.org/datasets/>.

Coded in Python3.

In this study, time and space complexities were analyzed for overall and targeted steps user-CF and item-CF. Influence of data size, and the quantity of recommendation on algorithm performance were studied. Finally, optimizations were investigated in penalizing popularities of item and user and normalization.
